            "Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.\n",
            "Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.\n",
            "Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and has gained widespread use in the machine learning community.\n",
            "\n",
            "History\n",
            "Python was invented in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as Python's \"benevolent dictator for life\" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker (he has since come out of retirement and is self-titled \"BDFL-emeritus\"). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.\n",
            "Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.\n",
            "Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it. Currently only 3.9 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. \"2.7.18+\" (plus 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) \"backported security updates\".\n",
            "In 2021 (and again twice in 2022, and in September 2024 for Python 3.12.6 down to 3.8.20), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution and web-cache poisoning. In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited and 3.8.13, because of many security issues. When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future. On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.\n",
            "Every Python release since 3.5 has added some syntax to the language. 3.10 added the | union type operator and the match and case keywords (for structural pattern matching statements). 3.11 expanded exception handling functionality. Python 3.12 added the new keyword type. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting. Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other changes.\n",
            "Python 3.13 introduces more syntax for types, a new and improved interactive interpreter (REPL), featuring multi-line editing and color support; an incremental garbage collector (producing shorter pauses for collection in programs with a lot of objects, and addition to the improved speed in 3.11 and 3.12),  and an experimental just-in-time (JIT) compiler (such features, can/needs to be enabled specifically for the increase in speed), and an experimental free-threaded build mode, which disables the global interpreter lock (GIL), allowing threads to run more concurrently, that latter feature enabled with python3.13t or python3.13t.exe.\n",
            "Python 3.13 introduces some change in behavior, i.e. new \"well-defined semantics\", fixing bugs (plus many removals of deprecated classes, functions and methods, and removed some of the C API and outdated modules): \"The  [old] implementation of locals() and frame.f_locals is slow, inconsistent and buggy [and it has] has many corner cases and oddities. Code that works around those may need to be changed. Code that uses locals() for simple templating, or print debugging, will continue to work correctly.\"\n",
            "Since 7 October 2024, Python 3.13 is the latest stable release, and 3.13 and 3.12 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support and Python 3.9 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.8 reaching end-of-life. Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support (up from one and a half); followed by 3 years of security support (for same total support as before).\n",
            "Some (more) standard library modules and many deprecated classes, functions and methods, will be removed in Python 3.15 or 3.16.\n",
            "Python 3.14 (now in alpha 1) has changes for annotations, with PEP 649 \"[preserving] nearly all existing behavior of annotations from stock semantics\".\n",
            "\n",
            "Design philosophy and features\n",
            "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming and metaobjects). Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming. Python is known as a glue language, able to work very well with many other languages with ease of access.\n",
            "Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\n",
            "Its design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter,mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.\n",
            "Its core philosophy is summarized in the Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:\n",
            "\n",
            "Beautiful is better than ugly.\n",
            "Explicit is better than implicit.\n",
            "Simple is better than complex.\n",
            "Complex is better than complicated.\n",
            "Readability counts.\n",
            "However, Python features regularly violate these principles and have received criticism for adding unnecessary language bloat. Responses to these criticisms are that the Zen of Python is a guideline rather than a rule. The addition of some new features had been so controversial that Guido van Rossum resigned as Benevolent Dictator for Life following vitriol over the addition of the assignment expression operator in Python 3.8.\n",
            "Nevertheless, rather than building all of its functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.\n",
            "Python claims to strive for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl's \"there is more than one way to do it\" motto, Python embraces a \"there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.\" philosophy. In practice, however, Python provides many ways to achieve the same task. There are, for example, at least three ways to format a string literal, with no certainty as to which one a programmer should use. Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, wrote: \"To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"\n",
            "Python's developers usually strive to avoid premature optimization and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity. Execution speed can be improved by moving speed-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or by using a just-in-time compiler like PyPy. It is also possible to cross-compile to other languages, but it either doesn't provide the full speed-up that might be expected, since Python is a very dynamic language, or a restricted subset of Python is compiled, and possibly semantics are slightly changed.\n",
            "Python's developers aim for it to be fun to use. This is reflected in its name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as the use of the terms \"spam\" and \"eggs\" (a reference to a Monty Python sketch) in examples, instead of the often-used \"foo\" and \"bar\". A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which has a wide range of meanings related to program style. \"Pythonic\" code may use Python idioms well, be natural or show fluency in the language, or conform with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. Code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.\n",
            "\n",
            "Syntax and semantics\n",
            "Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.\n",
            "\n",
            "Indentation\n",
            "Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure. This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule. Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.\n",
            "\n",
            "Statements and control flow\n",

            "The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block\n",
            "The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true\n",
            "The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses (or new syntax except* in Python 3.11 for exception groups); it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block is always run regardless of how the block exits\n",
            "The raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception\n",
            "The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming\n",
            "The def statement, which defines a function or method\n",

            "The break statement, which exits a loop\n",
            "The continue statement, which skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next\n",
            "The del statement, which removes a variable—deleting the reference from the name to the value, and producing an error if the variable is referred to before it is redefined\n",
            "The pass statement, serving as a NOP, syntactically needed to create an empty code block\n",
            "The assert statement, used in debugging to check for conditions that should apply\n",
            "The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function (and also an operator); used to implement coroutines\n",

            "The import and from statements, used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program\n",
            "The match and case statements, an analog of the switch statement construct, that compares an expression against one or more cases as a control-of-flow measure.\n",
            "The assignment statement (=) binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed data type; however, it always refers to some object with a type. This is called dynamic typing—in contrast to statically-typed languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type.\n",
            "Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Van Rossum, it never will. However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided by extending Python's generators. Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; data was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, it can be passed through multiple stack levels.\n",

There are two types of divisions in Python: floor division (or integer division) // and floating-point/division. Python uses the ** operator for exponentiation.\n",
            "Python uses the + operator for string concatenation. Python uses the * operator for duplicating a string a specified number of times.\n",
            "The @ infix operator. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.\n",
            "The syntax :=, called the \"walrus operator\", was introduced in Python 3.8. It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.\n",
            "In Python, == compares by value. Python's is operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference), and comparisons may be chained—for example, a <= b <= c.\n",
            "Python uses and, or, and not as Boolean operators.\n",
            "Python has a type of expression named a list comprehension, and a more general expression named a generator expression.\n",
            "Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, there may be only one expression in each body.\n",
            "Conditional expressions are written as x if c else y (different in order of operands from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages).\n",
            "Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples, written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as keys of dictionaries, provided all of the tuple's elements are immutable. The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but produces a new tuple containing the elements of both. Thus, given the variable t initially equal to (1, 2, 3), executing t = t + (4, 5) first evaluates t + (4, 5), which yields (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), which is then assigned back to t—thereby effectively \"modifying the contents\" of t while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.\n",
            "Python features sequence unpacking where multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned (to a variable, writable property, etc.) are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals—and, as a whole, are put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an iterable object on the right-hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions; when iterated through them, it assigns each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.\n",
            "Python has a \"string format\" operator % that functions analogously to printf format strings in C—e.g. \"spam=%s eggs=%d\" % (\"blah\", 2) evaluates to \"spam=blah eggs=2\". In Python 2.6+ and 3+, this was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g. \"spam={0} eggs={1}\".format(\"blah\", 2). Python 3.6 added \"f-strings\": spam = \"blah\"; eggs = 2; f'spam={spam} eggs={eggs}'.\n",
            "Strings in Python can be concatenated by \"adding\" them (with the same operator as for adding integers and floats), e.g. \"spam\" + \"eggs\" returns \"spameggs\". If strings contain numbers, they are added as strings rather than integers, e.g. \"2\" + \"2\" returns \"22\".\n",
            "Python has various string literals:\n",

It also means that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a%b is, as expected, in the half-open interval [0, b), where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (b, 0] when b is negative.\n",

            "Python allows Boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.\n",

              "' - [Derek] This is the\\nfirst in a series of videos about a chemical reaction\\ndiscovered over 125 years ago. It releases a tremendous amount of heat. Oh no, the GoPro. Liquefying metal. It is so hot. It is not an explosive, but it can cause explosions. That is crazy! But the reactants are so inert, they can withstand a\\nblow torch indefinitely. Do you think this whole thing\\'s going to blow up in my face? In fact, when Hollywood directors wanted something that\\nlooked like a nuclear bomb, this is the reaction they chose. But in its most common use, one basically unchanged in over a century, it has helped move billions\\nof people all over the world. In the late 1800s, Karl\\nand his younger brother, Hans Goldschmidt, were preparing to join\\nthe family business. Their father owned a chemical factory making dyes for fabrics. So they studied chemistry\\nunder Robert Bunsen of Bunsen burner fame. After their father\\'s early death, Karl took over management of the company, later joined by his younger brother. One of Hans\\' first major research aims was to find a way to produce pure metals. These were essential for\\nmaking dyes for everything from clothing and\\ntablecloths to wallpaper. At that time, good dyes\\nwere hard to come by. Most were faint and\\nfaded further after use. Some required the collection of large quantities of exotic insects. These days, we take color for granted, but in this drab world,\\npeople would pay handsomely for bright color fast dyes. One such dye was Scheele\\'s green, which was chemically copper arsenite. As its name suggests, it was toxic, though exactly how toxic\\nis a matter of debate. Still, it became the\\ndominant green dye by the end of the 19th century because\\nits color was unbeatable. The red color of the\\nBritish Army officer\\'s coats was made from cochineal, a central American insect mixed with tin. The addition of tin made the\\ncolor darker and more intense. So the demand for pure metals was strong. - They had their experience\\nin purifying metals by dissolving them in\\nsolutions or in acids and all kinds of things. - [Reporter] The incoming cyanide solution goes on dissolving the particles\\nof gold left in the sand after amalgamation and liquefies it. - And then work with the\\nsalts, purify the salts, and then reduce the salts\\ninto the metal state. And every step that you\\nwould take would then again cause problems, right? Reducing it in a furnace, you have to deal with all the exhaust and the contamination through the carbon. - [Derek] And metals are very difficult to separate from each other. - They basically, they form\\na mixed crystal, right? - Like an alloy.\\n- Like an alloy, right. They all become, in a sense, one substance that has one melting point, which is why you have to\\nkind of take some steps to separate them. - [Derek] So Hans came\\nup with a novel idea. He would react a metal\\noxide like chromium oxide with aluminum metal, and his hope was that the\\noxygen would swap partners, forming aluminum oxide and pure chromium. This type of reaction is now\\nknown as an aluminothermic or thermite reaction. So I have come to visit\\nElectro-Thermit in Germany, a company that is a direct\\ndescendant of Goldschmidts. I feel like they\\'ve\\nset this up like a tour of Willy Wonka\\'s Chocolate Factory, but instead it\\'s a thermite factory. Here we are going to try to replicate Han\\'s first successful reaction. All experiments in this\\nvideo were performed under the supervision of professionals taking proper safety precautions. - Originally, the first\\nexperiment was using chrome, but we are using copper,\\nwhich is comparable. - [Derek] This is like 300 grams. - [Axel] Yeah, 300 grams of thermite. - Pour it in? All right. We pour it into the crucible and ignite. All right. - Yeah.\\n- That\\'s it. - Yeah.\\n(shouts) - Leave it, leave it, leave it. - Whoa! (laughs) That is like fireworks.\\nWell, that\\'s impressive. - [Axel] But you bet he was\\nsurprised when he saw that. (both laughing) Handful of aluminum powder,\\nand then you get this. - [Derek] As you can see, the reaction releases a lot of energy. The temperature of thermite\\nreactions typically exceeds 2,000 degrees Celsius, and\\nit can be as much as 2,500. That\\'s because aluminum forms\\nvery strong bonds with oxygen. When those bonds form, they\\nrelease a lot of energy, way more than is required to\\nbreak the copper oxide bonds we started with. This energy melts all the\\nproducts of the reaction and makes them glowing hot. It is hard to express\\njust how bright they are. It feels like staring at the sun. If you see clips in this video where the highlights are overexposed, it\\'s because it is so hard to judge how bright the reaction will be, and it\\'s almost always\\nbrighter than you expect. So that dropping down the bottom there, is that liquid copper? - [Axel] That\\'s liquid copper\\nand basically the solution that was being created. - [Derek] But if you get this hot mixture of pure metal and aluminum oxide, how do you separate the two materials to isolate the pure metal? We\\'re trying to set up an experiment that no one has ever seen before and it\\'s actually going to allow us to see inside the crucible. We cut the crucible in half\\nand we\\'re attaching two pieces of thermally resistant glass,\\neach four millimeters thick, as a window into the reaction. People said this would be impossible, that you wouldn\\'t be able to see anything or that the glass would just break. - We\\'ve never done this on\\ncamera and really seen it this way, this clear. And I think it\\'s going to be fascinating to then start to analyze\\nand make sense of this. - Now this glass has\\nbeen specially treated, so it shouldn\\'t shatter immediately when it comes into\\ncontact with molten metal. Ah, that is hot. That is really hot. But the melting temperature of silica is around 1,700 degrees Celsius, which is definitely lower than the temperature of the reaction, so the glass certainly will melt. The hope is it melts slowly\\nenough to contain the reaction. - The glass will melt and at the end, we have just a very thin\\nlayer of the glass at the end. So you will ignite it. It\\'s up\\nto you to place the igniter. - I think someone else should ignite it. I think someone else should ignite it. - [Christof] Why? - Because I don\\'t trust myself. We saw how incapable I\\nwas of igniting yesterday. That\\'s it? (shouts) - Leave it, leave it, leave it. - [Derek] For this reaction, we\\'ll be using iron thermite, so a combination of iron\\noxide and aluminum metal. Okay, that\\'s good. Let\\'s do this. Holy. Oh no, the GoPro. Oh boy. Oh no. Oh no. That\\'s the end of the GoPro. The reaction starts at the igniter and expands outwards in all directions. To me, it almost looks like\\nants or mold or something. It looks organic in how\\nit\\'s sort of spreading. You see a pulse. Boom, boom, boom. - [Christof] It\\'s living. - Yeah, that\\'s what it looks like. Why is there pulsing? - I don\\'t know.\\n- Okay. - We try to understand.\\n- Huh. - We never knew that it did that. We do this for 100 years and\\nand suddenly you find out, you know, every portion\\nthat gets ignited does that. - Do you think that\\'s gas escaping up and that\\'s almost what causes the pulsing? Like some gas heats up\\nand then it shoots up and then it makes space for the next one? That\\'s what you seem to see over here. - [Christof] Yeah. - Wow, that is hot. That is really hot. I wanted to get a closer look, so I asked them to put some\\nthermite on top of glass, and then I would shoot from\\nbelow using this probe lens. - I\\'m ready.\\n- Okay, we\\'re rolling. It\\'s rolling, it\\'s rolling, it\\'s rolling, it\\'s rolling, it\\'s rolling. There it goes, there\\nit goes, there it goes, there it goes, there\\nit goes, there it goes. Wow! Yeah! The exposure\\'s pretty good. Oh my goodness. Incredible. This is the closest I think anyone\\'s ever filmed a thermite reaction. You can see that the\\nreaction proceeds in bursts, it reacts fast, but\\nthen pauses for a moment before advancing again. - Should I take it? - Sure. Yeah, take it, take it,\\ntake it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it,\\ntake it, take it, take it. Oh boy. I have two ideas about why this might be. First, there might is a mixture of grains, big particles of aluminum and iron oxide, and they need to be\\npresent in the right ratio to react efficiently. Maybe a little pocket reacts\\nout to where the ratio is slightly less ideal\\nuntil the heat builds up enough to trigger the\\nreaction in the next pocket. My second idea is that in\\nbetween the grains, there is air. The reaction heats the air, which expands, increasing the pressure between the grains and possibly pushing some\\nof the unreactive material away from the reaction front. So once that air escapes,\\nthe next patch can ignite. Once all the thermite has reacted, things get really violent. Molten metal is ejected out\\nof the top of the crucible, and inside, the liquid is sloshing around. This could be due to some\\nof the materials boiling, actually turning from liquid into a gas. Now, I know it sounds wild to\\nthink about metals boiling, but the boiling point of\\naluminum is around 2,500 Celsius. Iron boils above 2,800 Celsius, and there are other\\nelements in the mixture like manganese that boil\\nat just 2,000 Celsius. Now, once that boiling stops,\\nthe liquid settles down, and now comes the key\\nto making pure metal. The density of liquid iron\\nis more than twice that of liquid aluminum oxide. So iron settles to the bottom as aluminum oxide floats to the top. Now, when the metal\\nmelts through the bottom of the crucible, the first\\nliquid to pour out is iron. Only after it has drained does the aluminum oxide or slag follow. You can actually see the change\\nfrom iron to aluminum oxide. Liquid iron has a viscosity like water, so you can see it coming\\nout there and splashing. And then the slag starts right there. Yeah, it comes out smooth. - [Christof] Really, really cool. - Whoa. - [Christof] And this\\nis more like warm honey. - [[Derek] Yeah, you can totally see it. Wow. It definitely gives you a\\nsense of being right there. And you can see the flames\\ncoming off the front. And it still records. Look at the bubbles on the glass. You see those bubbles? And that beautiful shot\\nof the iron pouring out. I mean, this is impressive work\\nfor a camera that\\'s on fire. We\\'re going to put a cobblestone, normal street paver inside here. It\\'s made of limestone. We\\'ll pour the thermite\\non top and then ignite it. And then we\\'ll see that the\\ncobblestone is less dense. Then that solution, it\\'s going\\nto come up to the surface. - Yeah. - Whoa. Okay. It looks like it\\'s breaking into pieces. That\\'s a good bit of lava. - [Axel] Did you see it? - Oh yes. Ordinary rocks like cobblestones\\nrise to the surface, just like the slag, as the\\ndenser metal drops to the bottom. And this is key to\\nproducing high purity metal in the crucible. So Hans Goldschmidt\\nhad developed a process to make pure metals like\\nchromium, copper, and iron. This could be great for\\nchemistry in making dyes, but Hans suspected it could\\nhave even broader applications. He patented the process in 1895 and wrote it up for publication. He wrote, \"The procedure that I have here is in its principle so\\nextraordinarily simple that I could hardly have\\nundertaken the time to present, if not for its surprising\\nand extraordinary effects.\" Thermite was a solution\\nlooking for problems. One of the first applications of thermite was to weld metal parts\\nin remote locations. - Wherever you need a very,\\nvery strong, very reliable weld and kind of a remote area\\nwhere you don\\'t have the luxury of bringing, you know, tons of equipment and tons of welding gear,\\nthat is useful for thermite. You know, some of the first customers were in fact shipping companies. When some shaft would break\\nin the middle of the ocean, at the time, you would be lost. And now having like thermite to be able to at least fix that in some way that would get you home\\nwas actually very useful. It was being able to fix\\nsomething or to fix cracks in engine blocks and to\\nbe super mobile with it, because you know, like we said, it takes two guys and the bucket. - Of course, in this case, the iron thermite would\\nactually not produce pure iron, but rather steel. This was done by including\\ncarbon and other alloying elements in the thermite powder. - Nobody needs pure iron.\\nPure iron is actually useless. It\\'s very soft, it corrodes\\nimmediately even in dry air, and nobody will want that, right? - You need iron with some carbon in it. - Exactly right. You need iron with some\\ncarbon, that makes it a steel. - So the majority of\\nthermite produced today is steel thermite. - You have this steel mill that you can, you know, move wherever\\nyou want it to have. After the end of the Cold War, we would use thermite\\nbasically to destroy, say gun barrels from tanks. Basically you have a portion of thermite that you basically stick\\ninto the gun barrel and then you would ignite it\\nand then it would basically weld the gun barrel and destroy it and it would be completely\\nuseless afterwards. Those are all kinds of weapons or stuff that were not useful anymore that we use thermite to destroy because it\\'s very quick\\nand it\\'s very safe. - And it\\'s very final.\\n- And it\\'s very final. Once you\\'ve put that in,\\nthere is absolutely no way of making use of that weapon again. - A modern application of thermite is to use the heat generated\\nto destroy information. Past a certain temperature, the Curie temperature,\\nmagnets lose their magnetism. So information stored\\non magnetic hard drives at high enough temperatures\\nbecomes unrecoverable. This looks like a very\\ndifferent form of thermite. - Yes. - I\\'m used to seeing it as a powder. - Before it was also powder and we dry it. - Can I pick it up or?\\n- Yes. - I mean, it\\'s like a\\nnormal piece of tile. - Yeah, lay it down.\\n- Whoa. (laughs)\\nThat\\'s amazing. That is cool. So if we want to make sure no one can read the information on this hard drive, I could put this on top? - Yeah. - There you go. When we ignite the crucible, we have this high temperature\\nfor a short moment. And here we have it for 10 minutes, so everything is destroyed. - So you\\'re controlling the energy release to make it slower here. - Yes. The temperature\\'s not so high, and reaction is slower. - I am going to light this thermite tile in all four corners, and it\\'s going to generate\\nheat for about 10 minutes, and we\\'ll see what it does to this laptop. All right, let\\'s light it. Ooh, I like this. See how it\\'s oozing? Whoa. It\\'s a totally different effect. Whoa. Yeah, that\\'s getting hot. It\\'s getting to the laptop\\nnow. This is really cool. Like you got to see the molten goo coming out from underneath that laptop. That is wild. After seeing so much thermite, this is a totally different version of it. Look at the puddle of metal there. Oh. Yeah, nobody\\'s getting\\nany data off that laptop. That is awesome. I did not expect to see\\nthe logo in thermite. Can I lift it?\\n- [Christof] Of course. (both laughing) - I\\'ve never destroyed\\ndata like this before, but every time I get a spam call, I wish I could just\\nmagically make the records of my phone number disappear. Fortunately, today\\'s\\nsponsor Incogni can help. Now, I used to get\\nseveral spam calls a day, which frustrated me so\\nmuch that I contemplated making a video where I would just mess with these spam callers to\\nget a small amount of revenge. But ever since I started\\nusing Incogni back in April, I no longer have to because\\nthey solve this problem for me. You see, there are a lot\\nof data brokers out there that collect all sorts of\\ndifferent information about you, like your name, phone\\nnumber, email address, and even your social security number. And then they sell this\\ninformation on the open market, which is why you can get calls from people who you\\'ve never even\\ngiven your number to. But Incogni battles these data brokers. You simply give Incogni permission and they figure out who has your data. And then they know which laws apply, and so they can send the right letter with the correct legal\\nterms to each data broker with the request to\\nremove your information. What I love about Incogni is\\nthat it\\'s super easy to use and it actually works, and\\nit saved me a ton of time. So far, they filled out\\n192 requests on my behalf, 145 of which have been completed, saving me over 108 hours of work. And it just keeps running\\nin the background, continuously protecting me\\nagainst these data brokers. The best part is that\\nsince I\\'ve signed up, I\\'ve hardly gotten any more spam calls. So to try Incogni and fight\\nagainst the data brokers, visit incogni.com/veritasium. Click that link down in the description or scan the QR code right here. And make sure to use the code veritasium to get 60% off the annual subscription. Head over to incogni.com/veritasium\\nto get started yourself. So I want to thank Incogni for sponsoring this part of the video,\\nand now back to thermite. Now you might think, given\\nthe amount of energy given off that thermite could be\\nused as an explosive, but it\\'s actually not well\\nsuited for that purpose. - What makes thermite so\\ninteresting and so important is that you can control it so well. If you have an explosion, you can kind of calculate\\nthe energy really well and say it\\'s, you know,\\nX amount of megajoules that you get out, but it\\'s really hard\\nto say over what time. - Maybe one of the reasons\\nwhy this is not explosive is because when you have\\nexplosive reactions, typically your reactants are solid and the products are gases,\\nwhich obviously expand a lot and create a lot of pressure. But in this case, both the reactants and products are solids? - They\\'re solids and liquids. - Yeah, right. You have so much control\\nover what\\'s going on. - Woo. I feel like I\\ngot a sunburn from that. This property makes it possible\\nto take down structures where explosives would\\ncause too much damage. In 1933, 4 weeks after Adolf Hitler became the chancellor of Germany, the Reichstag building\\nin Berlin was set on fire and it would only be fully\\nrepaired 24 years later. But the burnt out steel\\ndome had lost its structural integrity and needed to be removed. Now, conventional explosives\\nwould\\'ve caused irreparable damage to the rest of the old building. So on November 22nd, 1957,\\nthermite charges were strapped to the dome and when ignited,\\nthey melted through the steel, which fell neatly into the\\nformer plenary hall below, allowing the repairs to be completed. Applications like this are possible because the thermite reaction\\ncan be carefully controlled. They have the ingredients so dialed in that you can actually ignite\\nthermite indoors without fear of molten metal flying all over the place. This mixture includes\\nsome pieces of pure steel. They don\\'t participate in the reaction, but they do absorb heat as they melt. So they help control the rate of reaction and the temperature reached. - [Axel] There you go.\\n- All right. - That\\'s it. - That\\'s it?\\n- Yes. - I don\\'t think it was in. Oh boy. Whoa. Wow. - It\\'s interesting, like looking\\nat it through dark glasses, it looks like a cornbread\\nmuffin or something. One of the really important\\nparameters to control is how long after the reaction\\nstarts does the metal start flowing out the bottom of the crucible. This is known as the tap time. It\\'s critical because if\\nthe tap time is too short, the metal inside doesn\\'t\\nfully separate from the slag. But if the tap time is too long, then the metal dissolves\\nmore silica from the walls of the crucible and it\\nalso comes out colder than it could have been. - So the chemistry of the\\nsteel actually changes over the time.\\n- The longer it stays in there.\\n- Exactly. The log it stays in there, and this is why it\\'s very\\nimportant for us to be able to control how long it\\nactually stays there. - You want the tap time to\\nbe somewhere in the middle, just right. We\\'ve set up this experiment here to test. Can we control the time\\nwhen the steel comes out? So the idea is it should\\ncome out of this one first, then this one, then that one. We\\'re going to ignite\\nall three simultaneously and see what happens. - You good? 3, 2, 1. Yes. They all ignited at almost\\nexactly the same time, but the top time of the first crucible, we got one, was by far the shortest. Two. It\\'d be amazing if this one stops and the third one goes, like that would be very, very impressive. Come on, third one. Wow. That\\'s great. That\\'s fantastic. Another attribute that can be controlled is the temperature of the metal. - Here we have two different versions. So we have a version with 12% damping, and here we have with 25. - Sometimes you want the metal to come out a little hotter or a little colder. There we go. Nicely controlled ignition. Well, that one goes a lot more. Wow. You could see the 12% one went first. Whoa! You can see that, you know,\\nthis one starts first, so you can get a bit of a sense, but I feel like both\\nof them reached 2,000. I don\\'t know. - The one on the right side is one of the less dampened portions, and the other one is one\\nof the more dampened ones. We could dramatically\\nchange the temperatures in both directions, a little bit higher and\\nsignificantly lower. - [Derek] All of this control is achieved by carefully adjusting\\nthe thermite mixture. - This is the starting point\\nof the making of thermite. About once or twice a day a truck comes and drops in this. This is mill scale. So this is basically a mixture\\nof different iron oxides. When you hot roll steel,\\nthe surface of the steel is very reactive because it\\'s so hot and there is so much water\\ninvolved to cool the rollers, so that the surface actually\\noxidizes very quickly and creates this mill scale. And then they use like water jets to blow it off the steel surface. And for the rolling mill, this is just a waste product, right? - [Derek] Whoa.\\n- [Axel] There you go. - That is cool. - The mill scale from\\noutside comes in here and then gets dried\\nbecause thermite and water, they\\'re not exactly friends and you want the mill scale\\nto be as dry as possible and then stay dry, so\\nthis is how we dry it. - The iron oxide is\\nshaken up the spiral ramp to the top floor, and there, the particles are separated\\ninto different sizes and compositions before being\\nmixed with aluminum powder. This also has to be very dry, I imagine. - It\\'s not as much a problem here because the way that\\nit\\'s being manufactured doesn\\'t contain any water. With the iron oxide,\\nit\\'s getting blown off with the water jets. We have to control all the\\nelements, the reactive elements, which is the iron oxide and\\nthe aluminum to make sure that every portion has their\\nvery defined reactivity. And then we get the reaction that we want and also the chemical qualities\\nin the steel that we want. - You guys use this word portion. - Portion, yeah. That\\'s\\nthe word that we use. A portion is basically\\none bag of thermite. - No cameras. - [Cameraman] Always\\nbreaking the rules, this guy. - [Derek] So the portions\\nare bagged up individually and stored in the warehouse. - This is our warehouse, but\\nthis is only one of them. And this is not even the biggest. - Can I ask you one question here? Okay, yesterday we saw there\\'s a tremendous amount\\nof energy in thermite and in this warehouse, there\\'s a tremendous amount of thermite. So the question for you is,\\nis this in any way dangerous? - It\\'s a fair question. It\\'s a fair question. - They set up this\\ndemonstration for me to see how safe thermite is to handle. They want me to try to ignite\\nthis full crucible of thermite with increasing sized ignition sources. But I wasn\\'t entirely\\nconfident this was a good idea. Maybe you can help me ignite it. - Where\\'s Christof? Have you tried this by the way? - [Christof] No. - Well then, under these circumstances, I would get you some safety gear. - [Christof] I\\'m 95% sure\\nthat you cannot ignite it. - 95?\\n- There you go. That\\'s safety gear.\\n- That\\'s a one in 20. Is that how we\\'re doing it? This is a fireproof suit. - At least there will be footage\\nhow it happened. (laughs) - So first, here\\'s a little lighter. All right, let\\'s give it a shot. See if I can get this to ignite. Three, two, one. I\\'m making some of the thermite\\nparticles here quite hot so that they are actually glowing orange. Oh, oh, oh. It\\'s getting quite bright. Are you getting worried watching that? - No, not getting worried. - I heard you make a noise and I was like, \"No, he\\'s getting worried. I shouldn\\'t keep it on the same spot.\" Do you think this whole thing\\'s\\ngoing to blow up on my face? - [Axel] No, I hope not. - So you can see like even getting it- - [Axel] Glowing hot.\\n- Glowing hot, it still won\\'t ignite. All right, let\\'s pull out a bigger torch. I\\'m going to try with this one. Got a nice big blue flame there. I feel like this is not as\\nhot as the other lighter, so I\\'m getting a little\\nbit of orange there, but just barely. We\\'re going to have to\\nbring out the big guns. All right, let\\'s torch\\nit in three, two, one. Do you think we can build up enough heat? How hot? - [Axel] 500. - Did you say 500?\\n- [Axel] Yeah. - I can see a lot of\\nthermite glowing orange. There\\'s some pieces coming out. - Nice and glowing.\\n- [Christof] 700. - 700 degrees. I think this is an excellent demonstration that thermite is not going to ignite under normal conditions. Wow. - [Axel] There you go. It\\'s still glowing. - [Derek] Did it melt? - [Axel] Yeah, that can happen. - It can melt and not- - Not ignite.\\n- Not ignite. What the. That is absolutely nuts. - Obviously, there is a lot\\nof potential energy here, but getting that energy is\\nreally, really difficult. So if it would catch a fire\\nand, you know, whatever, the wooden pallets would burn, you would not be able\\nto ignite the thermite. - Would not even. - No, it would just sit there\\nand it would just ignore you. - The key to this lack of\\nreactivity is the aluminum powder. - The aluminum is quite stable because it\\'s covered in aluminum oxide, and only if it gets so violently heated that that layer breaks down in\\na large number of particles, then the reaction can start. - So the aluminum oxide\\nis like the secret stopper of thermite?\\n- [Axel] Exactly. - The seal. This reaction has a very\\nhigh activation energy, so it can\\'t be started by a\\nlighter or a propane torch. Okay. This is why we\\'ve been using\\nbarium hydroxide igniters. Basically, the same stuff\\nthat\\'s in sparklers. - [Christof] Happy New Year. - It gets hot enough to break through the aluminum oxide\\nlayer and start the reaction. - We want to make sure that\\nthe ignition temperature is so high that it can\\nonly light it deliberately. Because once it\\'s going. - [Derek] I am going to push\\nthe button in three, two. - There is no way of stopping it. (thermite explodes) - That is crazy. I was filming in Germany\\nfor a full five days, so this is just a taste of what\\'s to come. We\\'ll find out how thermite\\nreacts with its environment and we\\'ll have a dedicated video on the most common\\napplication of thermite, welding railroad tracks together. There probably will be millions of people watching this video. Most of them have probably\\nridden on a train. What is the likelihood\\nthat they have ridden over one of your thermite welds? They will. - [Derek] 100%?\\n- 100%. - [Derek] So make sure you\\'re subscribed to be notified about these\\nvideos when they come out.'"
